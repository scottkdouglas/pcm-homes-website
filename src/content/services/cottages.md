## Cottage & A-Frame Construction

Escape to your own private retreat. We specialize in building cottages and A-frame cabins throughout Ontario's beautiful cottage country.

### Year-Round or Seasonal

With proper planning and scheduling, we can build your cottage any time of year. Our typical cottage builds range from 1,300 to 1,800 square feet.

### Kit Builds & Custom Design

While A-frame kits are currently popular, we're not limited to any particular style. We can build any type of cottage or structure that suits your needs and location.

### Popular Uses

- Personal vacation retreats
- Family cottages
- Rental properties
- Weekend getaways

### Timeline

Kit builds (cottages): 6-8 months, barring delays. Custom designs may require additional time for planning and permitting.

### Cottage Country Expertise

We have extensive experience building in Muskoka Lakes, Kawartha Lakes, and throughout cottage country in Ontario.
